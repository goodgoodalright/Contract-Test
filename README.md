# Freelance Alliance Contract (Draft 1)

### Adapted from Samuel Sycamore's CA CK adapted from Andy Clarke and Stuff & Nonsense Ltd. [the original killer contract](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer/).
#### 4/12 - Updated to read as a group (us/we) instead of an individual (I)
#### 4/12 - pending review: all [items] subject to negotiations (e.g., customer, payment schedule and rates, etc.)
#### 4/12 - Do we include how we are breaking up the work / compensation amongst ourselves or is that a separate document not shown to the client and this is just a contract between the customer and our business as Freelance Alliance? 
#### 4/12 - composed in Markdown to share on GitHub as it is a little more secure (and version-friendly) than Google Docs; the final document can be transferred to a word processor for polishing.
##### Shout-out to all the homies from #100devs! I hope you find this helpful!

# The Contract

Between FREELANCE ALLIANCE
And [customer name] 

## Summary

We will always do our best to fulfill your needs and meet your expectations and believe that it is important to have these needs and expectations written down. This allows both parties to clearly understand what is being requested, who should do what and by when, and what will happen if something goes wrong.

In this contract you will not find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. We do not want to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What we do want is what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.

_In short_:

> You ([customer name]), located at [customer address] (“You”) are hiring Freelance Alliance (”Us”/”We”) to:
>
> [Design and develop a web site] For the estimated total price of [total] as outlined in our previous correspondence.

## What do both parties agree to?

You: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organization. You will give us the assets and information that we tell you we need to complete the project. You will do this when we ask and provide it in the formats we request. You will review our work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner. We will both be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to adhere to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.

Us: We have the experience and ability to do everything we have discussed with you and we will do it all in a professional and timely manner. We will do our best to meet every deadline that is set and we will maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us.

## Design

We create designs that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. We create these iteratively using HTML and CSS and it would be a poor use of our time to mock up every template as a static visual. We may use visuals to indicate a creative direction (color, texture and typography).

You will have plenty of opportunities to review our work and provide feedback. We will share a Github repository and development site with you and we will maintain regular contact via phone, email, or any video chat provider we agree to, such as Zoom or Skype.

If — at any stage — you change your mind about what you want delivered or are not happy with the direction our work is taking, you will pay us in full for the time we have spent working until that point and may terminate this contract.

## Text content

Unless agreed separately, we are not responsible for inputting text or images into your content management system or creating every page on your website. We do provide professional copywriting and editing services, so if you would like us to create new content or input content for you, we will provide a separate estimate.

## Graphics and photographs

You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, we can suggest stock libraries. If you would like us to search for photographs for you, we can provide a separate estimate.

## HTML, CSS and JavaScript

We deliver pages developed from HTML markup, CSS stylesheets for styling, and JavaScript for behavior.

## Browser testing

Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person’s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

We test our work on current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Edge), and Mozilla Firefox. We will not test in other older browsers unless we agree upon that separately. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

## Mobile browser testing

Testing using popular smaller screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. We test our designs in:

iOS: Safari and Google Chrome Android: Google Chrome

We will not test in Opera Mini/Mobile, specific Android devices, or other mobile browsers.

## Technical support

We are not a website hosting company so we do not offer support for website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting. You may already have professional hosting. If you do not, we will recommend one of our preferred hosting providers. We can set up your site on a server if you would like, and will provide a separate estimate for that. After the site goes live, updates to and management of that server will be up to you.

For most projects, we prefer a serverless solution to save both time and money. This means that your website is hosted in the cloud so there is no need for server management. We will recommend this option when we feel it is appropriate.

## Search engine optimization (SEO)

We do not guarantee improvements to your website’s search engine ranking, but the pages that we develop are accessible to search engines. We do offer search engine optimization services, and can provide a separate estimate for that.

## Changes and revisions

I do not want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the amount of time that we estimate we will need to accomplish everything you have told us you want to achieve, and we are happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that will not be a problem - we will provide a separate estimate for the additional time.

## Legal stuff

We will carry out our work in accordance with good industry practice and perform at the standard expected from a suitably qualified entity with relevant experience. That said, we cannot guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we cannot be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you have advised us of them.

Your liability to us will also be limited to the amount of fees payable under this contract and you will not be liable to us or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if we have advised you of them.

Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

## Intellectual property rights

“Intellectual property rights” means all patents, rights to inventions, copyright (including rights in software) and related rights, trademarks, service marks, get up and trade names, internet domain names, rights to goodwill or to sue for passing off, rights in designs, database rights, rights in confidential information (including know-how) and any other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all applications (or rights to apply) for, and renewals or extensions of, such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection which subsist or shall subsist now or in the future in any part of the world.

You guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by you, or that you have permission to use them. When you provide text, images or other artwork to us, you agree to protect me from any claim by a third party that I'm using their intellectual property.

We guarantee that all elements of the work we deliver to you are either owned by us or we have obtained permission to provide them to you. When we provide text, images or other artwork to you, we agree to protect you from any claim by a third party that you are using their intellectual property. Provided you have paid for the work and that this contract has not been terminated, we will assign all intellectual property rights to you as follows:

You will own the website we design for you plus the visual elements that we create for it. We will give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as we are not required to keep a copy. You own all intellectual property rights of text, images, site specification and data you provided, unless someone else owns them.

We will own any intellectual property rights we have developed prior to, or developed separately from this project and not paid for by you. We will own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and we will license its use to you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise.

## Displaying our work

We love to show off our work, so we reserve the right to display all aspects of our creative work, including sketches, work-in-progress designs, and the completed project on our individual and team portfolios and in articles on websites, articles in magazines, and in books.

## Payment schedule

You agree to pay for our services as outlined in the following payment schedule:

[Payment details] [Payment schedule]

We issue invoices electronically. Our payment terms are [number] calendar days from the date of invoice by Venmo or PayPal. All proposals are quoted in US dollars.

We reserve the right to charge interest on all overdue debts at the rate of [percentage] per month or part of a month.

## The not-so-small print

Neither of us can transfer this contract to anyone else without the other’s permission.

Both parties agree that we will adhere to all relevant laws and regulations in relation to our activities under this contract and not cause the other to breach any relevant laws or regulations.

This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legally binding document.
